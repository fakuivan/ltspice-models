# SPICE symbol library with LTspice assemblies

This is a collection of SPICE compatible models and LTspice assemblies.
To import these into LTspice open the "Simulate" menu then click "Control Panel",
there go to the "Sym. & Lib. Search Paths" tab and input the path to this directory
in both the "Library Search Path" and "Symbol Search Path" text fields and accept the
changes. When you want to add any of these components to your schematic, while in the
"Select Component Symbol" window select this directory from the "Top Directory" drop-down
list, the assemblies here should be listed.
